# Progress – 2026-01-18

## What changed
- Polished 2048 header: mini glass buttons for Scores/Settings, gold primary CTA, and full-height Undo for consistent sizing.
- Tightened score/best chips with centered text and theme-aware colors for both light and dark modes.
- Leaderboard rebuilt into glassy cards with clear names, medal ranks, stacked undo/turn stats, and a transparent sheet that lets the popup background show through.
- Button styling unified via `ui-button` variants (primary/secondary/gold/mini) instead of per-screen overrides.
- Documentation refreshed to capture the design component usage so future UI fixes reuse the shared library.

## Notes / next steps
- Keep using the shared button variants and leaderboard card structure for any new overlays to avoid ad-hoc styling.
- If adding new stats to leaderboards, extend the existing `.lb-stat-stack` rather than changing the row layout.
