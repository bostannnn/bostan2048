# Progress - 2026-01-19

## What changed
- Expanded the 2048 touch target: introduced a `.game-stage` wrapper sized to the full play area with safe-area padding and `touch-action: none`, so swipes register even in the empty space beneath the board.
- Pointed the pointer-based `KeyboardInputManager` at `.game-stage` first (falling back to `.game-container`) to unify swipe handling across the larger hitbox without blocking header buttons.
- Documented the new input behavior in README, TDD, and roadmap for future UI work.

## Notes / next steps
- If any overlay (e.g., effect canvas) steals touches, set `pointer-events: none` on that layer to keep swipes responsive.
- After deployment, ask PWA users to reload/clear cached data so the new bundle and styles take effect.
