# Progress 20260118

## Findings (code review)
- Firebase leaderboards still need the composite index (gameId asc + score desc) to avoid “requires an index” errors; indexRequired flag is set but won’t resolve without creating the index. (src/core/FirebaseManager.js)
- Economy/coins UI is now hidden, but EconomyManager still emits updates; if you re-enable coins, ensure a visible element with .score-value exists or guard the updater further. (core.js)
- Bottom nav is completely hidden; only 2048 is reachable. This matches “2048 only” but blocks city/shop testing without CSS changes. (style.css)

## Changes made now
- Hid coins chip in the 2048 header (.currency-container { display:none; }).
- Hid the bottom nav to gate unfinished features; 2048 remains accessible via the header.
- Settings cog lives in the header group; click delegates to the settings overlay even when injected.
- Increased contrast on stat labels (Score/Best/Coins label styling adjusted).
- Centered CTA text on the game-over button via flex centering and line-height.

## Docs updated
- README.md: noted current scope (only 2048 exposed; nav hidden; coins UI suppressed).
- TDD.md: added current UI state (2048-only surface, hidden nav/coins, settings via header cog).
- roadmap.md: added navigation gating item.

## Notes on “coins label”
- The label is still in the DOM but hidden via CSS per request. If you want to debug visibility instead, remove the display:none on .currency-container in src/games/2048/style.css.

## Files touched
- src/games/2048/style.css (hide coins, stat label contrast, CTA text centering)
- style.css (hide bottom nav)
- app.js (settings overlay delegation)
- README.md, TDD.md, roadmap.md (current progress/scope)

## Next steps (optional)
1) If you want the Coins label visible again, remove the display:none on .currency-container; I can also harden the updater to no-op when hidden.
2) If you need nav back for testing city/shop, I can re-show it but keep disabled states.
